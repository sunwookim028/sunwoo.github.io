    <h2>Practical Novel Compute</h2>
    <p><b>Introduction</b> We need to sustain computing performance growth to scale human-centric innovations over future generations.
    Environmental causes will continue to raise the cost for energy and carbon use.
    At the same time, ROI of computing power seems far from diminishing.
    Professinals across sectors imagine transformative impacts of powerful applications like AI.
    More technical options in terms of performance per cost will enable wide-ranging innovations, providing affordable options for emerging players like startups or developing countries.
    To achieve this, we should expand our arsenal, bringing in out-of-the-box hardware and abstractions.
