    <h2>Research Proposal</h2>
    <h2>Practical novel compute for efficiency -> to foster more human-centric innovations to come, until the last day of humanity.</h2>
    <p>Can we scale-up AI services upon system designs of today? Do we have the technology options to scale computing profitably?</p>
    <p>Astonishing percentage of our neighbors are in the BOP. Can they afford today's data centers to compete?</p>
    <p>**Theme** Let's innovate computer system design to sustain performance scaling.</p>
