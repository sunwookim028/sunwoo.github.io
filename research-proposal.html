    <h2>Practical Novel Compute</h2>
    <p><b>Introduction</b> We need to sustain computing performance growth to scale human-centric innovations over future generations.
    Environmental causes will continue to raise the cost for energy and carbon use.
    At the same time, returns from more computing power seems far from diminishing.
    Professinals across sectors imagine transformative impacts of adopting powerful applications like AI.
    Moreover, wider range of performance per cost options is needed to broaden the scope of innovations.
    Diverse players like startups or developing countries could leverage affordable technology options.
    This calls us to expand our arsenal, to bring out-of-the-box hardware and abstractions into future systems.
